# BDTNet

The aim of this code base is creating a neural net capable of accuratly predicting optical and mechanical propoerties of a specific class of optomechanical device developed by F. Mayor, A. Primo, S. Malik, and S. Gyger in the Safavi-Naeini Lab at Stanford.  This device enables colocalization of high quality facotr opticla and mechanical modes which are interestign for the task of quantum transduction and frequency conversion.

This repository provides code is designed to enable rapid prediction of optical and mechanical quality facotrs of variants of the base design.  In particular, the model is trained to predict optical and mechanical properties based on displacements and scale changes in the etched crystal holes.
